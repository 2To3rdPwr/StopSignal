# StopSignal
StopSignal test

This is an android app designed as a stop-signal response test for the Transportation Research Group in the 
UCF Applied Experimental and Human Factors Program.

Participants have a set amount of time to respond to an auditory tone by pressing the left button if a low tone is played,
the right button if a high tone is played, or not responding to whatever tone is played if the phone vibrates.

Data from each trial is recorded and saved to the device's documents directory in the StopTrials folder.
